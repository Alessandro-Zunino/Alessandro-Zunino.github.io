Hypothesis
Polymeric anisotropic soft microparticles show interesting behavior in biological environments and hold promise for drug delivery and biomedical applications. However, self-assembly and substrate-based lithographic techniques are limited by low resolution, batch operation or specific particle geometry and deformability. Two-photon polymerization in microfluidic channels may offer the required resolution to continuously fabricate anisotropic micro-hydrogels in sub-10 µm size-range.
Experiments
Here, a pulsed laser source is used to perform two-photon polymerization under microfluidic flow of a poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate (PEGDA) solution with the objective of realizing anisotropic micro-hydrogels carrying payloads of various nature, including small molecules and nanoparticles. The fabrication process is described via a reactive-convective-diffusion system of equations, whose solution under proper auxiliary conditions is used to corroborate the experimental observations and sample the configuration space.
Findings
By tuning the flow velocity, exposure time and pre-polymer composition, anisotropic PEGDA micro-hydrogels are obtained in the 1–10 μm size-range and exhibit an aspect ratio varying from 1 to 5. Furthermore, 200 nm curcumin-loaded poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) nanoparticles and 100 nm ssRNA-encapsulating lipid nanoparticles were entrapped within square PEGDA micro-hydrogels. The proposed approach could support the fabrication of micro-hydrogels of well-defined morphology, stiffness, and surface properties for the sustained release of therapeutic agents.}
