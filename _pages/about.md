I am a physicist with a deep interest in optics -- both classical and quantum -- and its applications to light shaping and imaging. I obtained a B.Sc. in Physics (2015) and an M.Sc. in Physics (2018) from the University of Milan (Italy). From 2018 to 2021, I worked as a Ph.D. student at the Italian Insitute of Technology (IIT) in Genoa (Italy) under the supervision of Prof. Mart√≠ Duocastella and Prof. Alberto Diaspro. In February 2022, I started working as a post-doctoral researcher in the Molecular Microscopy and Spectroscopy laboratory of IIT under the supervision of Dr. Giuseppe Vicidomini. My current research efforts are dedicated to developing a microscope exploiting non-classical properties of light and designing innovative image processing techniques.
